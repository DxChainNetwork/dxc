 * @dev Library for managing

 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)[sets] of primitive

 * types.
   *

 * Sets have the following properties:
   *

 * - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time

 * (O(1)).

 * - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering.
     *

 * ```

   ```

 * contract Example {

 * // Add the library methods

 * using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;
    *

 * // Declare a set state variable

 * EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet;

 * }

 * ```
   *
   ```

 * As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`)

 * and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported.
   *

 * [WARNING]

 * ====

 * Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable.

 * See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
   *

 * In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableSet.

/**

 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed

 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an

 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer

 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
   *

 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be

 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in

 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
   *

 * For example:
   *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

   ```

 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {

 * function initialize() initializer public {

 * __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");

 * }

 * }

 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {

 * function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {

 * __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");

 * }

 * }

 * ```
   *
   ```

 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
   *

 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure

 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
   *

 * [CAUTION]

 * ====

 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
   *

 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation

 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke

 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
   *

 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]

 * ```

   ```

 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor

 * constructor() {

 * _disableInitializers();

 * }

 * ```
